Task 05
---

Create a script that simulates pinging a remote server. It takes two named parameters. The first parameter is the IP-address of a server, second how many times the ping is tried. The script also ask the permission to make ping with. Pings are made only if a user says Yes. Give default values for the parameters, so if the script will be run without the arguments, it will try to ping `192.168.1.1` only once. Because `ping` is blocked in the labranet, we simulate only pinging.
