<# 5.1
[ ] Create a script that creates new accounts for a placebo system (placebo means here that the system not really exists). 
[x] The script takes one parameter `filename`. The parameter points to a csv file including user names. 
[x] Check first that the given file exist, then read all lines. 
[x] User's account is created by taking 
  [x] first four characters of lastname and 
  [x] two characters of firstname. 
  [x] The account contains only lowercase letters. 
[x] Show a message greeting the user by full name, and telling them their new usernames 
[x] If the given file does not exist, the script will show an error message.
