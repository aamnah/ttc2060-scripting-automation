Create a script that takes two parameters: foldername and newname. Check first if the given folder, exists. If not, show a proper message and quit the script. If the folder exist, count files in the folder, and ask from a user: "All {number} files will be renamed with name {newname}. Yes/No". If the user returns "Yes", rename all files in the folder.
